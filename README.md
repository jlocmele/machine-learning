NSC3003 Group Project: Machine Learning for Medical Diagnostics
  
  Third year group project looking at machine learning for medical diagnostics. Past projects in this area have involved looking
  at likelihood of developing heart disease, and more recently the likelihood of developing complications due to COVID-19.
  
  This repository contains learning resources looking at machine learning for python and data visualisation, as well as the medical data set 
  used for this project, which contains common risk factors for breast cancer and whether patients developed it within 1 year.
